# Bank Management System

## Project Goal
This is a simple Bank Management System made with C++. Its main goal is to help users manage customer details and bank transactions easily using a clear menu.

## Key Features
* **Customer Management**: Add, delete, update, view, and search for customer information.

* **Transactions**: Do and track deposit and withdraw operations.

* **User Management**: Control system user accounts.

* **Login Register**: Keep a record of user logins and logouts.
  
## How It Works
The system runs in a text-based window (command line). It shows you a menu to choose what you want to do, then guides you through the process.
